# japan-travel-wishlist
I first created a prototype in Figma to organize my ideas and see what works and looks good and what does not. 
Then I rebuilt it as good as possible with Html and CSS and during the process I adjusted a few things that were not yet present in the prototype.
To keep it simple, I gave each image an external link to allow the visitor to learn more about the country from an external source. 
On the wishlist.html page you can hover over the images to see what's on them and click the link for more info.

Currently I'm still working on making the website responsive and the submit form functional with PHP.
